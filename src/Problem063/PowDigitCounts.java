 * The 5-digit number, 16807=7^5, is also a fifth power. Similarly, the 9-digit number, 134217728=8^9, is a ninth power.

/*
Let's consider the pow k^n.

For k: If k = 10, k^n has exactly (n + 1) digits. ex. 10^1 = 10, 10^2 = 100, etc. So exclude k = 10.
If k > 10, k^n > 10^n which has at least (n + 1) digits. As a result, k > 10 are excluded.
So we have 1 <= k <= 9 (one digit positive integers).

For n: If n = 22, take the biggest possible num to be formed: 9^22 â‰ˆ 9.8 * 10^20 which is 21 digit long < 22
If n > 22, same thing happens: num is just too small to be n-digit length
So we have 1 <= n <= 21.
